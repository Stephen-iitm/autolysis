# Report on Life Satisfaction Dataset Analysis

## 1. Data Overview

The dataset under review comprises 2,363 observations and 11 columns, focusing on various dimensions of life satisfaction across different countries from 2005 to 2023. The dataset includes the following variables:

- **Country name**: Identifier for the country.
- **Year**: Year of observation.
- **Life Ladder**: A measure of life satisfaction.
- **Log GDP per capita**: Logarithm of GDP per capita, indicating economic performance.
- **Social support**: Measure of social support available to citizens.
- **Healthy life expectancy at birth**: Average number of years a newborn is expected to live in good health.
- **Freedom to make life choices**: Index reflecting individuals' freedom to make personal decisions.
- **Generosity**: Measure of charitable giving and social generosity.
- **Perceptions of corruption**: Citizens' perception of corruption in their countries.
- **Positive affect**: Measure of positive emotional experiences.
- **Negative affect**: Measure of negative emotional experiences.

### Missing Values

The dataset contains several missing values across different columns, with notable counts in:
- **Generosity** (81 missing values)
- **Perceptions of corruption** (125 missing values)
- **Healthy life expectancy at birth** (63 missing values)

This missing data must be addressed during analysis to ensure robustness and accuracy.

## 2. Analysis Conducted

### a. Correlation Analysis

The correlation between "Life Ladder" and other numerical features was analyzed. This step is crucial in identifying attributes that strongly associate with life satisfaction. The correlation matrix was visualized as a heatmap, highlighting relationships between variables.

### b. Trends Over Time 

An exploration of life satisfaction trends over the years was conducted, revealing patterns indicating whether happiness levels have improved or declined.

### c. Country Comparisons

Average life satisfaction was compared across various countries to identify which regions exhibit higher or lower life satisfaction levels.

### d. Economic Factors Impact

The relationship between economic indicators, notably "Log GDP per capita," and life satisfaction was investigated to illustrate economic influences on happiness.

### e. Missing Data Analysis

An assessment of the missing values helped identify potential patterns or biases resulting from missing data, which can affect the analysis outcomes.

### Visualization Code Snippets

Various visualizations were created to support the analysis:

1. **Correlation Matrix Heatmap**: A visual representation of the correlations between variables.

## 3. Insights Discovered

- **Strongest Correlation**: The analysis uncovered that "Log GDP per capita" and "Social support" exhibited the strongest positive correlations with "Life Ladder," suggesting that economic prosperity and social connections are crucial for life satisfaction.
  
- **Trends**: Average life satisfaction showed a mild upward trend over the examined years, with some fluctuations. This may denote improvements in certain countries or overall global happiness, despite disparities.

- **Regional Differences**: Certain countries consistently scored higher on the "Life Ladder," revealing significant disparities potentially linked to economic development, governance, and social structures.

- **Generosity and Corruption**: Surprisingly, perceptions of corruption had a noteworthy relationship with life satisfaction. Countries where citizens perceive lower corruption levels generally have higher life satisfaction scores.

## 4. Implications and Suggestions

### a. Policy Implications

The findings suggest that investments in economic growth and fostering social support networks could enhance overall life satisfaction. Policymakers should focus on:

- Improving economic conditions, specifically targeting GDP per capita growth.
- Strengthening social welfare systems to enhance social support mechanisms.
- Reducing corruption through transparency and governance improvements.

### b. Future Research Directions

- Further investigation into qualitative factors influencing life satisfaction.
- Conducting regression analyses to quantify the impact of various predictors on life satisfaction.
- Longitudinal studies to assess the long-term effects of socio-economic changes on well-being.

### c. Addressing Missing Data

Strategies should be developed to handle missing data, such as imputation techniques or conducting sensitivity analyses to understand the impact of missing values on conclusions drawn.

The analysis of this dataset contributes valuable insights into the complex relationships between socio-economic factors and life satisfaction across various global contexts.
